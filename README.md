My dotfiles
===========

My dotfiles for the macOS, very much based upon other people's works.

About this repository
---------------------

- This is my dotfiles repository; its settings are based upon great pioneers found in the GitHub community and elsewhere on the internet.
- Please note that my dotfiles are still _incomplete_; **please use them at your own risk**.
    - First of all, I would suggest consulting the setups by great hackers listed in the [**Acknowledgements**](https://github.com/shoichiaizawa/dotfiles#acknowledgements) section below.
    - However, please feel free to browse my settings :-)
